 *
 *  Algorithm to adaptively create a HyperVolumeBinning for a
 *  specific HyperPointSet, taking limits from a HyperCuboid. 
 *
 *  \todo rememer how this algorithm works - its something along these
 *  lines... Fits the points in the bin with a flat line, then fits it 
 *  with a step fuction (that has 3 free parameters, height before step
 *  height after step, and step point ). The step point that maximises
 *  the likelihood is chosen as the split point. 
 * 
 *  Additionally, you can compare the significance of splitting in different
 *  dimensions using the likelihood ratio of the flat line and the step function.
 *  choose to split in the dimension that gives the biggest significance.
